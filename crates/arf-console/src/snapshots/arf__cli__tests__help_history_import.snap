Import history from another source (experimental)

Import command history from radian, R's native .Rhistory, or another arf database. This is an experimental feature and the format may change in future versions.

Usage: import [OPTIONS] --from <FROM>

Options:
      --from <FROM>
          Source format to import from

          Possible values:
          - radian: radian history file (~/.radian_history)
          - r:      R native history file (.Rhistory)
          - arf:    Another arf SQLite history database

      --file <FILE>
          Path to the history file/database to import. Defaults: radian=~/.radian_history, r=.Rhistory, arf=history.dir/r.db

      --hostname <HOSTNAME>
          Override hostname for imported entries. Marks entries to distinguish them from native arf history

      --dry-run
          Perform a dry run without actually importing

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
