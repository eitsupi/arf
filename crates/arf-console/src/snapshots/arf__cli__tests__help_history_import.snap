Import history from another source (experimental)

Import command history from radian, R's native .Rhistory, or another arf database. This is an experimental feature and the format may change in future versions.

Usage: import [OPTIONS] --from <FROM>

Options:
      --from <FROM>
          Source format to import from

          Possible values:
          - radian: radian history file (~/.radian_history)
          - r:      R native history file (.Rhistory)
          - arf:    Another arf SQLite history database

      --file <FILE>
          Path to the history file/database to import. Defaults: radian=~/.radian_history, r=.Rhistory, arf=history.dir/r.db

      --hostname <HOSTNAME>
          Override hostname for imported entries. Marks entries to distinguish them from native arf history

      --dry-run
          Perform a dry run without actually importing

      --import-duplicates
          Import duplicate entries instead of skipping them. By default, entries that already exist in the target database are skipped (anti-join on command text and timestamp)

      --unified
          Treat the input file as a unified export file (with both R and shell tables). By default, files named r.db/shell.db are treated as single-database files, and other filenames are treated as unified export files. Use this flag to explicitly import from a unified file regardless of filename

      --r-table <R_TABLE>
          Table name for R history in unified export file. Only used when importing from a unified arf export file
          
          [default: r]

      --shell-table <SHELL_TABLE>
          Table name for shell history in unified export file. Only used when importing from a unified arf export file
          
          [default: shell]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
